# node-express

This is a starter ExpressJs project. 
The server will be listening to request on port `3000`,
so you can test the server in a browser accessing `http://localhost:3000` or via `cURL`.

## Running the application locally

### Building locally
Before running the app, you need to install the dependencies by running this command:

```shell
npm install
```

### Running the application locally

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run it as a standalone app by running the following command from the root of the project:

```shell
npm run server
```

### Access the local application

Access the local application by opening your browser using the URL [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or use `cURL`.

## Tanzu Platform deployment
